Give reasons for the following: (a) Red phosphorus is less reactive than white phosphorus. (b) Electron gain enthalpies of halogens are largely negative. (c) N 2 O 5 is more acidic than N 2 O 3 . Solution: (a) Red phosphorus are less reactive than white phosphorus as the white phosphorous posses angle strain in the P 4 molecule where the angle are only 60 & also they have low M.P .” (b) Electron gain enthalpy of halogen are largely negativity it is due to the fact that they have high effective nuclear charge & smallest size among period. Although they contain 7 e  in valence shell & required one electron to attain their nearest noble gas configuration. (c) N 2 O 5 is more acidic then N 2 O 3 as in N 2 O 5 the N is in +5 O.S. while in N 2 O 3 it is in +3 O.S. So higher the oxidation state of central atom in a given oxide, higher will be acidic character 22. Give reasons for the following: (a) Acetylation of aniline reduces its activation effect. (b) CH 3 NH 2 is more basic than C 6 H 5 NH 2 . (c) Although – NH2 is o/p directing group, yet aniline on nitration gives a significant amount of m-nitro aniline. Solution: (a) ","CBSE-XII-2017 EXAMINATION 9 / 14 Reason: - Reactivity of aromatic amine is very high so when acetylation aniline occur with acid anhydride it get convert into acetanilide in which L.P on Nitrogen are in conjugate with oxygen atom due to resonance hence the reactivity reduce (b) CH 3 – NH 2 is more basic then C 6 H 5 – NH 2 Because In case of aniline the L.P of – NH2 (amino group) are in conjugation with benzene ring due to which e – density less available on N-atom hence higher the electron density on N-atom more will be the basicity. (c)  – NH 2 group of aniline is ortho-para directing group but on nitration it also give meta product as the aromatic amine (aniline) is highly reactive and it react with acidic hydrogen of nitrating agent and form anilinium ion which gives meta product. 23. After watching a programmer on TV about the presence of carcinogens (cancer causing agents) Potassium bromate and Potassium iodate in bread and other bakery products, Rupali a Class XII student decided to make others aware about the adverse effects of these carcinogens in foods.

Assign reason for the following : (i) H 3 PO 2 is a stronger reducing agent than H 3 PO 4 . (ii) Sulphur shows more tendency for catenation than Oxygen.

Solution: Students may find similar question in CP board pattern exercise sheet: (i) Chapter: p-block elements, Section-A, Q.34(iii) (ii) Chapter: p-block elements, Section-A, Q.25 (C) (i) H 3 PO 2 is a stronger reducing agent than H 3 PO 4 because in H 3 PO 2 oxidation state of 'P' is +1 while in H 3 PO 2 oxidation state of 'P' is +5. Hence, H 3 PO 2 can be oxidized to higher oxidation state while in H 3 PO 4 , 'P' is present in its highest oxidation state. (ii) Sulphur shows more tendency for catenation than oxygen because S-S bond energy is higher than O-O bond energy. Tendency of catenation depends on bond energy of single bond between identical atoms. (iii) As we move from HF to HI bond length increases. Hence, removal of hydrogen becomes easier and chance of oxidation also increases. Order of reducing character: HF < HCl < HBr < HI 17.

(c) Anisole on reaction with HI gives phenol and CH 3 – I as main products and not iodobenzene and CH 3 OH. Solution: (a) The protonation of phenol is difficult because in phenol the l p. of oxygen atom are use in resonance with benzene ring and oxygen atom have low electron density where as in ethanol the electron density on oxygen atom is increases due to +I effect of C 2 H 5 group which makes it's protonation easy. (b) Boiling point of ethanol is higher because ethanol form intermolecular hydrogen bond with each other but in ether there is no hydrogen bonding is possible and hence ether have low boiling point in comparison to ethanol 19.
